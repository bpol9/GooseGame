# GooseGame
A simple and fun board game in Java. You can read about the rules [here](https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/goose-game-rules.htm).

In order to try it, you first have to download [Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
Then while inside the editor, select File->Open Project, select the folder containing the repo and once it is opened hit the 'Run Project' button at the toolbar.

As it was developed under time pressure, it is not based on the best coding practices and may be a bit unreadable.
